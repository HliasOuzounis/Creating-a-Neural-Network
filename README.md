# Creating a Neural Netowrk

## Introduction
This project is part of a machine learning project I worked on during my first year at the University of Patras.

While learning the math behind machine learning algorithms, I decided to create my own neural netowrk. This project contains the final product of the neural netowrk as well as 3 examples of it's use with the results.

## Technologies 
Project is created with:
* Python 3.8
* numpy 1.19.3
* sklearn 0.24.1

## Content
1. *"My_Neural_Network"* folder which contains the 3 files that comprise the neural network  
    * **functions.py**: has the activation functions used by the neural network: relu, sigmoid, tanh, linear and their derivatives
    * **My_Neural_Network.py**: works as the main body of the neural netowrk and is the file imported in the examples
    * **Neural_Network_Layers.py**: has the details of each layer along with the necessary functions  
2. **boston_house_prices.py**: an example where the neural network is used to predict the average house price in towns in Boston
3. **Fish_dataset.csv**: a dataset with the weights and characteristics of fish commonly found in the market
4. **fish_weight.py**: an example where the neural network is used to predict the weights of fish from the Fish_dataset.csv
5. **Iris_plants.py**: an example where the neural network is used to classify different Iris plants based on characteristics
6. **README.md**: this file

## Inspiration
This project is heavily inspired by the MLPRegressor from the sklearn library. Although inspiration for the structure of the neural network was taken, no parts of the code were copied or modified. All the code in this project was made exclusively by me.
